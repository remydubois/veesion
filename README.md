This repo contains the source code for the 20 billion neurons jester challenge (https://20bn.com/datasets/jester/v1#download): a video classification task focused on simple gesture classification. 

## Models
Three models are implemented as of now: all are 3D CNN models loosely based on succesful architectures for image classification (SqueezeNet, VGG16, and a naive model constituting a baseline). All are implemented in Keras for time matter.
